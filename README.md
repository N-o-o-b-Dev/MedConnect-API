N-o-o-b-Dev/MedConnecMedConnect Backend API 🚀 This is the Spring Boot backend for MedConnect, an all-in-one healthcare platform designed to facilitate doctor bookings, medicine purchases, order tracking, and patient management. This backend powers the core business logic, APIs, and data management needed to support MedConnect's mobile and web applications.

Features 🏥 User Authentication: Secure registration and login using JWT. Appointment Management: APIs for booking and managing doctor appointments. Medicine Inventory and Sales: CRUD operations for managing medicines and processing orders. Token System: API for token booking and managing patient queues. Patient Medical History: Store and manage detailed patient medical history. Order Tracking: Real-time status tracking for medicine orders and deliveries. Notifications: Email and SMS notifications for reminders and updates. Tech Stack 🛠️ Backend Framework: Spring Boot (Java) Database: MySQL Authentication: JSON Web Token (JWT) Notifications: Twilio for SMS and SendGrid for email notifications (or similar services) Payment Gateway: Integrated API for handling transactions Getting Started 📥 To set up the backend locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites Java 11 or higher Maven (for dependency management) MySQL (local or hosted) Installation Clone the Repository

bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/username/MedConnect-backend.git cd MedConnect-backend Configure MySQL Database

Create a new database for MedConnect in MySQL. Update your application.properties or application.yml file with your database connection details: properties Copy code spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/medconnect spring.datasource.username=your_username spring.datasource.password=your_password spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update Configure Environment Variables Create a .env file or set environment variables directly in the application. Include the following keys:

JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT signing. SENDGRID_API_KEY and TWILIO_API_KEY: API keys for notifications. PAYMENT_API_KEY: API key for payment processing. Build and Run the Application Use Maven to build the project and run the application.

bash Copy code mvn clean install mvn spring-boot:run Access the API Once started, the API will be available at http://localhost:8080.
